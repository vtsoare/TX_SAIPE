# TX_SAIPE
This repository will contain Jupyter notebooks demonstrating aspects of data analysis using the 2020 SAIPE data for Texas. 
The SAIPE survey estimates poverty rates in the US and is organized by state and then by county.

The data I use pertains to the state of Texas, and can be found at https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/datasets/2020/2020-state-and-county/est20-tx.txt
The technical documentation for the data can be found at https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/technical-documentation/file-layouts/state-county/2020-estimate-layout.txt

In the first file I obtain the data and clean it. I also create a few visualizations to better understand the data.
