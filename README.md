# TX_SAIPE
This repository will contain Jupyter notebooks demonstrating aspects of data analysis using the 2020 SAIPE data for Texas. 
The SAIPE survey estimates poverty rates in the US and is organized by state and then by county.

The data I use pertains to the state of Texas, and can be found at https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/datasets/2020/2020-state-and-county/est20-tx.txt
The technical documentation for the data can be found at https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/technical-documentation/file-layouts/state-county/2020-estimate-layout.txt

In the first file, TS_Clean, I download the data and clean it up, fixing some formatting issues that arised from the original data being a TXT file, and adding column names. I save the file to be used in other notebooks.
